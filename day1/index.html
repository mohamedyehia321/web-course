        <p>TikTok, <a href="https://www.britannica.com/topic/TikTok" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">social media</a> platform designed for creating, editing, and sharing short videos between 15 seconds and three minutes in length. TikTok provides songs and sounds as well as filters and <a href="https://www.britannica.com/art/special-effects" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">special effects</a> that users can add to their videos. Users also have the option to upload videos from their own devices to TikTok. TikTok is available to people in most countries around the world. <a href="https://www.britannica.com/place/China" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">China</a> has a separate version called Douyin that has the same basic functionality but includes content of interest to the Chinese public.</p>
        <p>Short-form videos initially achieved popularity in 2013 thanks to Vine, an app that allowed users to create and share clips that were just six seconds long. The following year saw the <a href="https://www.britannica.com/topic/TikTok" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">debut</a> of Musical.ly, a Chinese social media platform that allowed for longer videos (from 15 seconds to one minute). It originally focused on the lip-synching craze, offering thousands of songs to which users could make entertaining lip-synching and dance videos. Musical.ly quickly gained popularity, especially among American teenagers, and within a few years it had tens of millions of users. At the end of 2017 the Chinese company ByteDance acquired Musical.ly for some $800 million. In the summer of 2018 <a href="https://www.britannica.com/topic/ByteDance" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">ByteDance</a> merged all the content and user accounts of Musical.ly into TikTok.</p>
